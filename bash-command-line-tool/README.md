# Bash Command-line Tools

This example shows how user arguments are handled.

You can try it with the following commands:

```
$ ./hello
usage: ./hello <name>
$ ./hello John
Hello John
```

Warning: please use this tool sparingly as bash script can get really messy when it has more complicated functionalities.
